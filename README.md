# Algorithms Preparation

## Algorithm Learning:

[MIT course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm)

[Stanford Course, Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

Both courses are very well structured. If you learn well from videos definitely dig into these.


## Algorithm Practice

- Leetcode http://leetcode.com/

There are a large number of problems and a very active community for discussions around specific problems and interviews at the tech companies.

Start with easy problems then move to medium when comfortable. 

Premium service adds enhanced searching and filtering of problems.

- Hackerrank http://hackerrank.com/

Free service has many problems and some structured areas focused on certain areas, e.g. specific languages.

- CodeChef https://www.codechef.com/

- CodeForces https://codeforces.com/

Wide set of coding problems targeted at competitive programming circles. Start with the easier problems and move up.

- InterviewCake

The service is structured as a full course of the algorithms and data structures you need for the interview. The pay service provides additional structure to the learning and practice sessions

- Pramp https://www.pramp.com/

Free Service allowing interview practice in a timed setting. You are paired up with another participant and alternate 45 minutes interview sesssions. I strongly recommend this service for getting used to the timing of the interview and communication with your interview partner.

- AlgoExpert https://www.algoexpert.io/product

This is a pay service with structured learning and practice sessions. The head of this service is very active on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g

- Interviewing.io https://interviewing.io/

This is a pay service for practice with interview problems but I never investigated it.


## System Design

Donne Martin system design primer:

https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer

Use the flash cards if that learning style works for you.

Ensure familiarity with these import concepts:

### CAP theorem
### How to reason about the choice betweeen SQL and noSQL databases
### When and how to use load-balancers
### Caches
### How to separate read traffic

- Anatomy of a System Design Interview https://hackernoon.com/anatomy-of-a-system-design-interview-4cb57d75a53f

Nicely structured article on how to prep for this interview.

Note that these interviews are highly formulaic and your industry experience is very valuable as long as you fit it into this structure.

Overall, communication ability is a key trait to show. Go broad at first and communicate possibilities on where to dive in.
