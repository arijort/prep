Data Structures and Alogs notes:

Sorting
  * bubbble sort
  * merge sort
  * quicksort
  * counting sort

Arrays

Hash Tables

Tree
  * DFS using recursion
  * DFS using iteraitve approach: with stack

  * BFS using queue

  * pre-order traversal : root, left, right
  * in-order traversal  : left, root, right
  * post-order traversal: left, right, root

Heap:
  * min heap has minimum element at root 
  * max heap has maximum element at root 

Priority Queue

  * Heap sort
  * Uses Heap as complete binary tree
  * Array with invariant property a[n] <= a[2n+1] and a[n] <= a[2n+2]

Dynamic Programming

Graphs

  * shortest path BFS
